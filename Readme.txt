1.	Connect the safety kit to a power source preferably laptop (can be used as a local monitoring station).
2.	Kit and the computer should all be connected to a local wifi.
3.	Once the kit is connected to the power source it  will start transmitting the data.
4.	Each and every floor will have a separate Bluetooth module to which all the safety kits in that respective floor will be connected to.
5.	If the heartbeat or the spo2 level is low then it will be indicated. Fall status will be shown with the location of the particular employee.
6.	Then open Firebase and select the mail id we want to access.

b)	Transmission of data using Wi-Fi to Firebase.
c)	Storing and monitoring data using our app.
